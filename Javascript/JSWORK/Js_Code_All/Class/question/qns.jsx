Hiding data + exposing functions.

4. What is Abstraction?

Hide complex details → show only necessary info.

🔥 MID LEVEL OOPS QUESTIONS

More real-world, asked in interviews.

12. What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?
13. What is the prototype chain?
14. Difference between:

Classical OOP vs Prototype-based OOP

20. What is super() and when do you call it?

21. Can we make Singleton in JavaScript?

(VERY COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTION)

22. What is composition vs inheritance?

(“Favor composition over inheritance”—important concept)

🚀 ADVANCED OOPS QUESTIONS

These are asked in system design + Node.js based interviews.

23. What is the diamond problem in inheritance?
24. What is Multiple Inheritance?

Does JS support it?

25. What is Mixins?

How JS achieves multiple inheritance.

26. What is SOLID Principles?

29. What is the difference between:

Public

Private

Protected (not supported by JS)

Static

30. What is Duck Typing?

Very important for JavaScript.

🧠 EXPERT / ARCHITECTURE LEVEL QUESTIONS

These are very strong interview questions.

31. Difference between OOP and Functional programming?
32. Why Node.js uses prototype-based OOP instead of classical OOP?
33. What is Abstract Class vs Interface?

(Though JS doesn’t have built-in interface)

34. Can you implement an Interface in JavaScript?

(Use TypeScript or manual checks)

35. What are Design Patterns?

Types of patterns:

Creational

Structural

Behavioral
