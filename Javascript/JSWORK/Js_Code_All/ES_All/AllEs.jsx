Map, Set, Symbols, destructuring

Why learn:

Essential for modern web development (React, Node.js, Vue, Angular).

Makes code cleaner, readable, and maintainable.

Most interview coding questions use ES6 features.

3. ES7 (ES2016) -----------------------------------------

Features:

Array.includes()

Exponentiation operator **

Minor update, mostly supplementary.

4. ES8 / ES2017

Mostly advanced / modern features for large-scale apps.


✅ Recommendation for Learning

ES5 → foundational knowledge, legacy support, and interviews.

ES6 → must-know for modern JS, frameworks, Node.js, and coding tests.

ES7+ → optional but useful for advanced projects and modern best practices.
