3️⃣ Difference from a normal variable
const OnlyCount = count * 5;


Without useMemo → recomputed on every render, even when num changes

With useMemo → recomputed only when count changes, saves computation (especially if it’s expensive)

4️⃣ How to explain in an interview (simple)

useMemo caches a computed value

Recalculates only when dependencies change

Useful for:

Expensive calculations

Filtering or sorting large arrays

Passing stable objects/arrays to children

✅ Mental model
count change → OnlyCount recalculates
num change   → OnlyCount uses cached value


If you want, I can improve your code and make it perfect React interview example, combining:

useMemo

useCallback

React.memo

So you can explain performance optimization like a pro.





:::::::::::::::::::::: RealLikfe Working -------------------------->>>

1️⃣ Real-Life Analogy

Think of useMemo like a calculator with memory:

You ask it: “What’s 5 × 10?”

It calculates once and remembers the answer.

Next time you ask 5 × 10 again, it just gives 
the answer from memory → no recalculation.

But if you ask “6 × 10”, it recalculates → updates memory.

💡 This is exactly what useMemo does in React.

2️⃣ Real-Life Example: Shopping Cart

Imagine an e-commerce site:

cart has 1000 items

You want to calculate total price of items in cart

You also have a UI counter for number of discounts applied

const totalPrice = useMemo(() => {
  console.log('Calculating total price...');
  return cart.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}, [cart]);


cart changes → total price recalculated ✅

discount counter changes → total price does NOT recalc ❌ (optimization!)

Without useMemo, total price would recalc on every render, even if unrelated state changes → slows app

3️⃣ Another Example: Filtering Users

Imagine admin dashboard with 5000 users

Only show active users

const activeUsers = useMemo(() => {
  return users.filter(u => u.isActive);
}, [users]);


If you update UI theme or another state, filtering won’t run 
again → saves CPU

Without useMemo, every render filters 5000 users → slow

4️⃣ Your code in real-life terms
const OnlyCount = useMemo(() => {
  console.log('hello');
  return count * 5;
}, [count]);


count = number of items added to a cart

OnlyCount = some calculation (like discount or reward points)

Clicking num button = some unrelated UI change

OnlyCount does not recalc → optimized

5️⃣ Key Takeaways

useMemo = cache for expensive calculations

Dependencies array = tells React when to recalc

Improves performance in large apps

Works great with:

Derived data

Filtering / sorting lists

Stable references for child components (React.memo)

✅ Interview One-Liner:

“useMemo caches a computed value and recalculates it only when its dependencies change, like remembering a previous calculation so React doesn’t waste time recalculating on every render.”



Imagine you have a list of 5,000 users and you want to filter them by name.

JavaScript

const filteredUsers = useMemo(() => {
  console.log("Filtering..."); // This only runs if 'search' or 'users' changes
  return users.filter(user => user.name.includes(search));
}, [search, users]); 
Why use it? If the user clicks a "Toggle Dark Mode" button, the component re-renders. Without useMemo, React would filter those 5,000 users again for no reason. With it, React just grabs the "saved" result.
