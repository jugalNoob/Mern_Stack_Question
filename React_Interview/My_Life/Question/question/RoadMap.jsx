🔹 1️⃣ Core React Concepts (Basics)

JSX – Syntax, expressions, conditional rendering

Components – Functional vs Class components

Props – Passing data from parent to child

State – useState, updating state, async nature

Event Handling – onClick, onChange, synthetic events

Rendering – Initial render, re-render, conditional rendering

Lists & Keys – map, importance of keys

🔹 2️⃣ React Hooks (Intermediate)

useState – Basic state handling

useEffect – Lifecycle replacement, cleanup, dependency array

useRef – DOM access, persisting values

useContext – Global state, avoiding prop drilling

useReducer – Complex state management

useMemo & useCallback – Performance optimization

useLayoutEffect – DOM measurement before paint

useImperativeHandle – Custom ref methods

Custom Hooks – Reusable logic

🔹 3️⃣ Advanced React Concepts

React Router – SPA routing, nested routes, route params

React Portals – Rendering outside parent DOM

Error Boundaries – componentDidCatch

Higher Order Components (HOC) – Reusable logic wrapper

Render Props – Passing function as prop for dynamic rendering

React.memo – Prevent unnecessary re-renders

ForwardRef – Passing refs to child components

Lazy & Suspense – Code splitting & dynamic import

🔹 4️⃣ State Management

Props vs State – When to use what

Lifting State Up – Sharing state between siblings

Context API – Global state

Redux / Zustand / Jotai / Recoil – Popular state management libraries

React Query – Server state caching & fetching

🔹 5️⃣ Performance & Optimization

Virtual DOM & Reconciliation – Diffing algorithm

Re-rendering – When React re-renders components

useMemo & useCallback – Memoization

React.memo – Preventing unnecessary child re-renders

Code splitting & lazy loading – Optimize bundle size

useTransition / useDeferredValue – React 18 concurrent UI

🔹 6️⃣ Forms & Controlled Components

Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs

Form validation (Yup, React Hook Form, Formik)

Handling multiple inputs & dynamic fields

🔹 7️⃣ React 18 & Concurrent Features

startTransition / useTransition

useDeferredValue

Automatic batching

Concurrent rendering basics

🔹 8️⃣ Testing in React

Jest + React Testing Library

Unit testing components

Snapshot testing

Event & state testing

🔹 9️⃣ React Patterns & Best Practices

Compound components pattern

Context + Reducer pattern

Controlled HOCs vs custom hooks

Clean folder structure & code organization

🔹 10️⃣ Additional Topics

Portals & Modals

Error Boundaries

Refs and DOM Manipulation

Animations (Framer Motion, CSS)

React with TypeScript
